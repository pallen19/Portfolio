          As a passionate Software Engineer I am so thrilled to start this new
          journey. Similar to your organization, I value the capacity of
          contributing and benefiting from growth processes in ways that
          recognize the value of their contributions, respect their dignity and
          make it possible to negotiate a fairer distribution of the benefits of
          growth. All while providing quality service. I conduct myself with
          fairness and transparency towards anyone I interact with. I know that
          I would particularly be a good match for this position because my goal
          is to deliver world class development, while utilizing my skills to
          get the job done. My education and experience has prepared me to work
          in fast paced environments, under pressure, while delivering high
          quality results. I have hopes in beginning my career with a company
          that has a great work-life balance like Block. I aim to grow as a
          Software Engineer, knowing I will be a great asset to your team.
